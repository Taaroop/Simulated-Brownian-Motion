# Simulated-Brownian-Motion
# This program simulates random Brownian motion by using the digits of pi
# The program contains different attempts to make the output (motion of a particle) as random as possible
# This is a link to the output of the program for brownian_motion(pi, 2, 1.5, [250, 250]): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A50NOUWek06FsNTD8mDw66ONo4ykzM8m?usp=sharing
